    * ...in itself and a benefit to you, be slandered due to your abuse of it. For the kingdom of God becomes clearly manifest not when Christians insist on pleasing themselves with their food and **drink but when their lives demonstrate righteousness and peace and [[Atlas/Maps/joy\|joy]] in the Holy Spirit. That is why the believer who serves Christ with such graciousness of life is a delight to God and convincing to man.** So then, let us work hard at developing a relational atmosphere conducive to harmony and growth together. Do not undo what God is doing in other believers' lives for the sake of mere food. Yes, all foods are clean. But it is wrong to exercise this freedom indifferent to the problems it creates for others. The right thing to do is not to eat foods or drink wine or do other things which could work mischief in the life of a fellow believer. If you have a strong faith, enjoy it in personal communion with God, not in causing trouble for other Christians. **Blessed is the one whose [[conscience\|conscience]] does not cast doubt on the choices he makes. But the one who is unsure when he eats something stands condemned in the very act, because his eating has taken his conscience out further than his faith can support him.** Every use of [[freedom\|freedom]] which is not rooted in one's real [[Atlas/Maps/faith\|faith]] is a sin.

    * PRAYER O Lord God, we modern Christians can be so self-absorbed. We look with condescension and boredom on the missionary enterprise--when we think of it at all. God, forgive us. We worship your Son in church on Sunday morning, we sing our choruses with a euphoric joy, and we think we have honored him. But what do we know of honoring Christ, when we remain content to let whole nations and peoples and tribes around the world live and die without ever bowing to the One whose name is above every other name? We have privatized our faith. We have trivialized it as a merely personal benefit, like a favorite television show or a hobby. We do not hear the gospel as a war cry, as a summons to risk-taking, as a command to see the Lord Jesus Christ honored in our own hearts as we exert ourselves toward his being honored in others' hearts. O God, your gospel spawns missionary effort as the sun radiates light. The two are always found together. What then does our lack of interest in missions reveal about our grasp of and love for the gospel? O Lord, give fresh power to the gospel among us. Revive in us the passion for Christian missions that thrust St. Patrick and William Carey and David Livingstone and Hudson Taylor and Amy Carmichael and thousands of others out to the four winds, for the honor and glory of the Son of God. Dear Lord, deliver us from our convenience Christianity and lift us up to the infinite joy of kingdom-advancing missionary Christianity. In the holy name of Christ. Amen. #prayer
    * You wonder why people choose fields away from the States when young people at home are drifting because no one wants to take time to listen to their problems. I'll tell you why I left. Because those Stateside young people have every opportunity to study, hear and understand the Word of God in their own language, and these Indians have no opportunity whatsoever. I have had to make a cross of two logs, and lie down on it, to show the Indians what it means to crucify a man. When there is that much ignorance over here and so much knowledge and opportunity over there, I have no question in my mind why God sent me here. Those whimpering Stateside young people will wake up on the Day of Judgment condemned to worse fates than these demon-fearing Indians, because, **having a Bible, they were bored with it, while these never heard of such a thing as writing**.

God, I pray Thee, light these idle sticks of my life and may I burn for Thee. Consume my life, my God, for it is Thine. I seek not a long life, **but a full one**, like you, Lord Jesus. [[Jim Elliot\|Jim Elliot]], 1951, 1948
